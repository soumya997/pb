# i dont know
thing is it feels so bad and vulnerable,like when the person with whome you compare your self and wanna be like him/her and one day surpass him/her gets ahead of you, and you are still the same. I really wanna be like that and want to touch the same heights like them,but the feeling of left behind maked me feel so bad, and the tears are just comes out when I think about it. But, when I go deep, then it really make sence that why he/she are that much great, for example they probably started their coing journey form class 10th or 11th or 12th and they are getting the results when they are in 2nd or 3rd year of their college, where i just started in my 2nd year and started doing it from the 2nd semester of of 2nd year, and by now what I have done in that time perioud thats good enough. And this thing is so common in programming world, that people even advise these things  often in Twitter/linkedin/yt. like
